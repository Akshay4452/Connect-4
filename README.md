# Connect-4 Game
🎮 Welcome to Connect-4, a classic game of strategy and skill with a twist! Similar to the childhood favorite Tic-Tac-Toe, but on a larger grid, this game challenges two players to connect four of their markers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Player 1 is represented by red markers, while Player 2 uses blue markers.

## Game Rules
📜 Here are the rules for Connect-4:

**Game Board:** The game is played on a 6x7 grid, consisting of 6 rows and 7 columns.

**Taking Turns:** Players take turns to make their moves.

**Placing Markers:** Players will be prompted to enter a column number (1-7) where they want to place their marker.

**Automatic Row Placement:** The game will automatically place the marker in the lowest available row in the selected column.

**Winning:** The objective is to be the first to connect four of their markers in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Once a player achieves this, they win the game.
